Notebook on kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/malakabdelbaki/medical-insurance-cost-prediction)
## Data Collection

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)



## Data Preprocessing

- No null values in dataset and no outliers
- Do encoding on categorical features
    - Gender
    - smoker : yes or no
    - region : southeast, southwest, northwest, northeast

### Data Analysis

- Distribution plots to explore continuous values:
    - Age
    - BMI
    - Charges paid
- Count plots to explore discrete values
    - Gender
    - number of children
    - Smoker : yes or no
    - region : southeast, southwest, northwest, northeast

### Splitting features and Target

- Split the dataset to 2 arrays
    - `X` : features
    - `Y` : target
    

### Split data into training data and testing data

- `X_train, Y_train` : 80% of data to train model
- `X_test, Y_test` : 20% of data to test accuracy

### Train the model

- Train a Linear regression model on `X_train, Y_train`

### Model Evaluation

- using R squared value compare the `Y_train`, with the predictions generated by the model
- Use the model to predict the cost for `X_test,` and using R squared value compare the `Y_test` with the predictions generated by the model
- R squared value for the model: 0.7447
